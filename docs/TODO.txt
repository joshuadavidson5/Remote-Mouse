Test how different kinds of networks (mobile, localhost loopback,
local wireless / wired) affect the UX.

Test if optimizing the implementation makes any difference:
- More efficient (binary) WS protocol
- Turning off console logging

Test if sending all / some (e.g. every Nth) mouse/touchmove positions
affect the UX.

Add measurements to get some numbers from the above, for the report.
