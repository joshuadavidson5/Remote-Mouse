Spent ~4h implementing basic WebSocket server and movement
functionality. Uses the ws package hooked up to express.js. Click
movements (positions) and clicks are dispatched to all connected
clients.

TODO: Channels/rooms; everyone connects now to the same session
TODO: Positioning doesn't work too well for different sized browser
      windows even on the same display... need to anchor position events
      to something?
