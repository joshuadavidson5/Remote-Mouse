* Test how different kinds of networks (mobile, localhost loopback,
  local wireless / wired) affect the UX.

* Test if optimizing the implementation makes any difference:
  - More efficient (binary) WS protocol?
  - Turning off console logging?
  - Packing multiple events in one message?

* Test if sending all / some (e.g. every Nth, or at most 10/sec)
  mouse/touchmove positions affect the UX.

* Add measurements to get some numbers from the above, for the report.

* Try circumventing Content-Security-Policy (e.g. Facebook), by
  combining all of the JS in the bookmark?

* Play with several pointers?

* Implement scrolling?

* Make remote somewhat better looking.

* Add presence indicator to remote ("is anyone listening?"), e.g. by
  sending the info (number of connected clients on channel?) once a
  second?

* Auto-create a random channel id?
