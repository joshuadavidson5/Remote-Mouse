\section{Introduction}

We are going to explore how to implement a virtual mouse pointer steered on the host by another device. Communications between the devices are going to be implemneted using WebSockets. Websockets are an efficient full-duplux bidirectional communications between a server and a client that enables to create low latency connections.

\section{Related work}

State of the art in industry and research includes applications made
conceptually possible by the nature of WebSockets. Another prominent
area of research is exploration of WebSockets' performance
characteristics and applicability in performance sensitive
applications.

\citet{throughput} explores the practical boundaries of throughput
achievable with HTML5 applications. The study uses WebSockets and Web
Workers.

\citet{compression} compare use of several compression algorithms with
WebSockets. WebSockets itself is an optimization over using HTTP for
purposes it was not designed for, and utilizing compression with it
takes the optimization one step further for some applications.

\citet{http2} study the use of HTTP/2's server push functionality in
order to improve user experience by making video streaming start
faster in DASH. They use WebSockets for estimating bandwidth and
compare WebSockets over HTTP/1.1 using dedicated TCP connection to
WebSockets over HTTP/2 transport multiplexing.

\citet{bassbouss} address multi-screen web application development and
the transformation of traditional web applications to multi-screen
capabilities. Both the current and proposed multi-screen application
models utilize WebSocket in communications between clients (screens)
and servers.

\citet{projectrooms} present a system implementing a virtual project
room and real-time collaboration space to facilitate remote,
distributed teamwork. The implementation uses WebSockets for
interclient communication and WebRTC signaling.

\citet{homeappliances} introduce an architecture for remote control for
home appliances. They address issues related to large scale deployment
of real time systems such as scalability and operational
costs. WebSockets is the central technology in their implementation.

\section{Research idea}

- Websockets
- Node and Express.js
- Client sends data to server who forwards it to host.
- First use as embedded plugin for website
- Investigate the option to work on any single-page app
- First implement simple click based navigation
- Later maybe tuoch based navigation
